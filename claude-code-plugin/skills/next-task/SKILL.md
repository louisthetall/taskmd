   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, run: `taskmd next`
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` contains flags, pass them through: `taskmd next $ARGUMENTS`
   - Common usage: `/taskmd:next-task --filter tag=mvp` to find the next MVP task
   - Phase filtering: `/taskmd:next-task --filter phase=core-cli` to find the next task in a specific phase
