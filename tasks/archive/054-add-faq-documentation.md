  - Can I use taskmd in a monorepo?
  - Does taskmd work with other task systems?
- [x] Add best practices questions
  - How should I organize task files?

## Example Questions to Include

**Installation:**
- Q: How do I install taskmd on macOS?
  - A: Install via Homebrew: `brew install driangle/tap/taskmd`. Alternatively, download from GitHub releases or install via `go install github.com/driangle/taskmd/apps/cli/cmd/taskmd@latest`.

**Task Format:**
- Q: What's the minimum required frontmatter for a task?
  - A: Only `id` and `title` are required. Example: `id: "001"` and `title: "My task"`. All other fields (status, priority, effort, etc.) are optional.

**CLI Usage:**
- Q: How do I see only pending tasks?
  - A: Use `taskmd list --status pending` to filter by status. You can also use `--exclude-status completed` to hide completed tasks.

**Troubleshooting:**
- Q: Why is my YAML frontmatter failing to parse?
  - A: Check that strings with special characters are quoted, arrays use proper YAML syntax (`["item1", "item2"]` or bulleted list format), and dates follow ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
