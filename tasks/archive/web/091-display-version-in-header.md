# Display taskmd Version in Web Header

## Objective

Show the current version of the taskmd program in the top-left corner of the web interface, next to the main logo. This gives users a quick way to confirm which version they are running.

## Tasks

- [x] Expose the taskmd version from the Go backend via an API endpoint or embed it in the initial page data
- [x] Display the version string next to the logo in the web header/sidebar
- [x] Style the version label to be subtle and non-intrusive (e.g., smaller font, muted color)
- [x] Ensure the version updates correctly across builds (uses the same version injected via ldflags)
- [x] Write tests for the version endpoint or data injection

## Acceptance Criteria

- The current taskmd version is visible in the top-left of the web UI next to the logo
- The version matches the output of `taskmd --version`
- The version label is styled subtly and does not disrupt the header layout
- Works correctly in both light and dark modes
