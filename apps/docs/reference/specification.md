# Task Specification

**Version:** 1.1

Each task is a `.md` file with YAML frontmatter and a markdown body.

```yaml
---
id: "001"
title: "Task title"
status: pending
---

# Task Title

Description and subtasks go here.
```

## Frontmatter Schema

### Required Fields

**`id`** - Unique identifier for the task. Use zero-padded numeric IDs (e.g., `"001"`, `"042"`). Must be unique across all tasks in the project.

> **Used by:** All commands for task identification. `get` and `set` use it for direct lookup.

**`title`** - Brief, action-oriented description of the task.

> **Used by:** `list`, `board`, `next`, `graph` for display. Shown in web views.

### Optional Fields

**`status`** - Current state of the task (recommended for all tasks):

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Not started (initial state) |
| `in-progress` | Currently being worked on |
| `completed` | Finished and verified |
| `blocked` | Cannot proceed due to a blocker |
| `cancelled` | Will not be completed |

```
pending → in-progress → completed
   ↓            ↓            ↓
   ↓         blocked        ↓
   ↓            ↓           ↓
   └──→ cancelled ←─────────┘
```

> **Used by:** `list` (filtering), `board` (column assignment), `next` (excludes completed), `graph` (exclude-status flag), `stats` (status breakdown), `set` (can update). Shown in web views.

**`priority`** - Importance level:

| Priority | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| `low` | Nice to have, can be deferred |
| `medium` | Standard work items (default) |
| `high` | Important for project success |
| `critical` | Urgent, must address immediately |

> **Used by:** `next` (scoring), `list` (filtering/sorting). Used as a filter in web board views.

**`effort`** - Estimated complexity:

| Effort | Typical Duration |
|--------|------------------|
| `small` | Less than 2 hours |
| `medium` | 2-8 hours |
| `large` | More than 8 hours / multi-day |

> **Used by:** `next` (scoring), `list` (filtering/sorting), `stats`.

**`dependencies`** - List of task IDs that must be completed before this task can start. Always reference by ID, always use array format:

```yaml
dependencies: ["001", "015"]
```

> **Used by:** `graph` (edge drawing), `next` (blocks recommendations until dependencies are satisfied), `validate` (cycle detection, missing reference checks).

**`tags`** - Labels for categorization and filtering. Use lowercase, hyphen-separated strings:

```yaml
tags:
  - core
  - api
```

> **Used by:** `tags` command (tag listing and counts), `list` (filtering). Used as filters in web views.

**`group`** - Logical grouping. If omitted, derived from the parent directory name. Root-level tasks have no group.

> **Used by:** `list` (filtering). Used as a filter in web views.

**`owner`** - Free-form string for assigning a task to a person or team. No validation is applied.

> **Used by:** `list` (filtering). Displayed in web views.

**`touches`** - List of abstract scope identifiers declaring which code areas a task modifies. Two tasks that share a scope should not be worked on simultaneously (risk of merge conflicts).

```yaml
touches:
  - cli/graph
  - cli/output
```

Scopes are user-defined identifiers. Concrete scope-to-path mappings can be configured in `.taskmd.yaml` under the [`scopes`](/reference/configuration#scopes-configuration) key. When scopes are configured, `touches` values not found in the config produce a warning. When no scopes config exists, all values are accepted silently.

> **Used by:** `tracks` command (assigns tasks to parallel work tracks; tasks sharing a scope are placed in separate tracks).

**`parent`** - Task ID of the parent task for hierarchical grouping. A task can have at most one parent. Children are computed dynamically by finding all tasks whose `parent` matches a given ID.

```yaml
parent: "045"
```

- Purely organizational — does not imply blocking or dependency
- No status cascading — completing all children does not auto-complete the parent
- Must reference an existing task ID; self-references and cycles are flagged by validation

> **Used by:** Hierarchical grouping in web views and reports.

**`created`** - Date when the task was created, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

> **Used by:** `list` (sorting). Displayed for informational purposes.

**`external_id`** - Identifier from an external system (e.g., a GitHub issue number or Jira issue key). Used to trace synced tasks back to their source. Written by the sync engine; not typically set manually.

```yaml
external_id: "PROJ-123"
```

> **Used by:** `sync` (tracks correspondence between local tasks and external issues).

Unknown frontmatter fields are preserved during read/write operations.

## File Organization

### File Naming

Task files follow this pattern:

```
NNN-descriptive-title.md
```

Where `NNN` is the zero-padded task ID and `descriptive-title` is a lowercase hyphen-separated slug. Examples:

- `001-project-scaffolding.md`
- `042-implement-user-auth.md`

The ID prefix may be omitted if the `id` field in frontmatter is the sole identifier.

### Directory Structure

Tasks can be organized into subdirectories for grouping:

```
tasks/
├── 001-taskmd-specification.md     # No group
├── web/                             # Group: "web"
│   ├── 001-project-scaffolding.md
│   └── 002-typescript-types.md
└── cli/                             # Group: "cli"
    ├── 015-go-cli-scaffolding.md
    └── 016-task-model-parsing.md
```

Group resolution priority:
1. Explicit `group` in frontmatter
2. Parent directory name
3. No group (root-level tasks)

## Validation

A valid taskmd file **must**:

1. Have YAML frontmatter enclosed in `---` delimiters
2. Include required fields: `id`, `title`
3. Use valid enum values for `status`, `priority`, `effort`
4. Have unique IDs across the project
5. Reference only existing tasks in `dependencies`
6. Have no circular dependency chains
7. Reference an existing task in `parent` (if set), with no self-reference or parent cycles

A valid taskmd file **should**:

1. Follow the `NNN-task-name.md` naming pattern
2. Include a creation date
3. Have a descriptive markdown body

## Examples

### Minimal Task

```markdown
---

The login button on the homepage is misaligned. Update the CSS to center it.
```

### Full Task

```markdown

  - auth
  - security
  - api

- [ ] Create login endpoint
- [ ] Create logout endpoint
- [ ] Add authentication middleware
- [ ] Write integration tests

## Acceptance Criteria
